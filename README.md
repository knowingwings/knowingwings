# Hi, I'm Tom 

**Mechatronics & Robotics Engineer** | MSc Robotics and Autonomous Systems @ University of Bath

I build robots that work in the real world: from manipulator arms to mobile platforms. My focus is on bridging the gap between simulation and hardware, with particular interest in **robotic manipulation**, **decentralised multi-robot systems**, and **ROS2 development**.

##  Currently Working On

- **Bath Rover Team** — Technical Lead for the robotic arm subsystem, competing in the European Rover Challenge (ERC)
- **Open-source rover platform** — Building an accessible, modular, well-documented mobile robot for education and research
- **MSc coursework** — Autonomy, AI/ML, and robot software engineering

##  Technical Skills

**Robotics & Control:** Manipulator kinematics & dynamics, motion planning, PID/state-space control, multi-robot coordination, system identification

**Languages:** Python · C++ · Rust · MATLAB/Simulink

**Frameworks & Tools:** ROS2 · Docker · Git · Linux · Siemens TIA Portal (PLC)

**Hardware:** Embedded systems (ARM, Arduino) · Sensor integration (cameras, LiDAR, encoders) · Motor control · PCB design

##  Featured Projects

### [decentralised-mobile-manipulator](https://github.com/knowingwings/decentralized-mobile-manipulator)
GPU-accelerated simulation framework for distributed auction-based task allocation in multi-robot systems. Implements decentralised control algorithms with provable convergence properties. Based on BEng dissertation research (First Class Honours).

### [epq-Robotic-Arm](https://github.com/knowingwings/epq-Robotic-Arm)
6-DOF robotic arm designed for my A-Level Extended Project (A* grade). Includes custom strain wave gearing, inverse kinematics implementation, and iterative mechanical design in Fusion360.
